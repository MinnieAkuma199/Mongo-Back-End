## Description

-I wanted to create a social network app using MongoDB as the back end. This is because of Mongo's flexibility with unstructured data and its ability to change large amounts of data with ease and speed. I wanted to mimic what many social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications and how it is used.

-I created an API completely from scratch for a social network web app. Users are able to share their thoughts, react to thoughts of friends, and create their own friend list (this includes allowing the user to add and delete friends, thoughts, and reactions). I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
